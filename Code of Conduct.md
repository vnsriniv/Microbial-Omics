# Microbial Omics Code of Conduct
## Welcome!
Microbial Omics is a community-led resource for networking, learning and collaboration.

The current admins are:
- Varun Srinivasan (vnsriniv@gmail.com)
- Mike Lee (Leemd@usc.edu)

To make clear what is expected, everyone taking part in the Microbial Omics slack group is required to conform to the Code of Conduct in order to ensure that this is a  fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone. We value the participation of every member of the scientific community and want all members to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.

## Code of Conduct
- The Microbial Omics slack workspace is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
- All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate under any circumstance.
- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down any other members of the group. Behave professionally and respectfully. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Thank you for helping make his a welcoming, friendly community for all.

## Message Retention
Because this is a free slack account, we have restricted scrollback, but Slack--the company--retains complete logs of all channels and direct messages back to the creation of Microbial Omics. Slack is a U.S. company and therefore subject to subpoenas from U.S. courts. Our logs may be subject to subpoena and could become public as part of legal proceedings.

## Harassment
Harassment includes:
- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate
- Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
- Deliberate intimidation
- Sustained disruption of discussion
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
- Publication of non-harassing private communication

## Reporting
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins either by email or by direct message. They'll respond as promptly as they can.
We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this slack and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.
